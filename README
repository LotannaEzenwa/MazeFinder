Team Oseleta: Janice Yip, Lotanna Ezenwa, and Emily Greene
We use a Mac OS X 10.9 computer, a Ubuntu 14.04 on Redhat Linux, and a Mac OS X 10.8 computer respectively to complete this project.

All information about our implementation and design decisions can be found in the design documentation.

The user must enter in their password in order to access the log.out file from the server.

We made the following assumptions when completing this project:
1) All components would remain in their current directory structure and would be called within each other appropriately.
2) The user who runs this program has a username that can log into pierce.cs.dartmouth.edu.
3) The user would have a computer compatible with the ASCII characters that we chose to display the graphics.
4) Included log files are a bit inconsistent as they were edited to include more information.
